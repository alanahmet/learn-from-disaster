# Learn from disaster

The goal is detect destroyed road after disasters like earthquake using aerial image.The idea came from massive earthquake in Turkey on february 6.After eartquake some of the most crucial issues are create supply chain and find gather areas and transport necessary tool.I am try to create and feed a dataset from arial image after earthquake and detect undameged roads.

- [X] Step 1
Create a model from [Massachusetts Roads Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/) and test with satellite image from earthquake.

- [ ] Step 2
Find data for training.Preferably taken from same satellite with same day on earthquake
