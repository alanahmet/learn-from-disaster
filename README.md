# Learn from disaster

The goal is detect destroyed road after disasters like earthquake using aerial image.The idea came from massive earthquake in Turkey on february 6.After eartquake some of the most crucial issues are create supply chain and find gather areas and transport necessary tool.I am try to create and feed a dataset from arial image after earthquake and detect undameged roads.

- [X] Step 1
Create a model from [Massachusetts Roads Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/) and test with satellite image from earthquake.

- [X] Step 2
Find data for training.Preferably taken from same satellite with same day on earthquake

I ask cimer which is offical comminication way to Turkey goverment for satellite images and there is no response for a month. Also it turn out deal with geodata is highly specialize area.I have unseccasfull attempt to label tiff file using label studio than i try turn tif to jpg and this time program crushed. This start as side project and it probably will take more time than i expacted.

- [ ] Step 3
Find way for labeling and cropping data similar to maxar.
